TODO New Features:
? Add the ability to set the product amount on a line permanently, ignoring previous requirements
  Not sure how to do this / how it would impact other things / what uses it would have


TODO Feature Improvements:
- Add a linebreak to the production table if the scroll pane width is exceeded


TODO Code Improvements:
- Loader should not irrevoquably destroy data / if the user saves then loads with the mods
  re-enabled, the subfactories should just show up like they did before
  (also, repairs should run automatically if caused by migrations)
  redo item generation, it is all kinds of wrong
- add a logging function that ignores parent fields


TODO Bug Fixes:
? Having coal as an ingredient and a fuel on a subfloor gives the wrong numbers on the parent line
  Fixing this is a lot of work, calc needs to be changed in all places pretty much
  Might not be worth to fix until the proper interface and/or overhaul happened
