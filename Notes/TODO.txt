TODO New Features:
? Add the ability to set the product amount on a line permanently, ignoring previous requirements
  Not sure how to do this / how it would impact other things / what uses it would have


TODO Feature Improvements:
- Add a linebreak to the production table if the scroll pane width is exceeded


TODO Code Improvements:
- Move to a proper planning tool (Trello or similar)
- restructure project folder structure
- add a logging function that ignores parent (and similar) fields
- add stashing and stash popping to the checkout_branch script
- top level items should adjust according to the view too
- Improve user warning/hint display: more messages, add priorities (and expiration time?)
- Improve refreshing stuff to make any sense at all (just refresh the whole damn thing)


TODO Bug Fixes:
? Having coal as an ingredient and a fuel on a subfloor gives the wrong numbers on the parent line
  Fixing this is a lot of work, calc needs to be changed in all places pretty much
  Might not be worth to fix until the proper interface and/or overhaul happened
