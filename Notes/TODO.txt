TODO New Features:
- Add an option to show whether machine numbers are perfect or rounded up


TODO Feature Improvements:
- Add a linebreak to production table if window width is exceeded
- Improve number formating (vary precision on use case, avoid scientific notation) (see base.util!)
- Ingredient limit for machines is optional, but still possible; this is not respected (needs machines data rework)
- Add more info on picker tooltips: product already exists, (not researched, hidden,) etc


TODO Code Improvements:
- Use settings consistently everwhere (game settings vs global.settings)
- Redo the view selection, it's a mess right now
- identify item, recipes and machines by id, not name
- Rework how machines are handled to be less clunky
? identify all gui elements by unique id or sth, not by string splitting.
