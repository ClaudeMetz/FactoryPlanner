TODO New Features:
! Add a proper way to deal with byproducts
- Choose favorite fuel that gets added on burner recipes [N1]
- Indication of how many belts/inserters are needed


TODO Feature Improvements:


TODO Code Improvements:
- Add thumbnail, screenshots, text for README.md, info.json

- Add picker tooltips that explain status of hovered item/recipe (needs better all_items data structure)
  (might be helped by indexing all items regardless of type, and proving the index and a type+name index)
  (recipe sprite detecting for custom recipes might be streamlined too with better prototype definitions)
- Add a linebreak to production table if window width is exceeded
- Improve number formating (vary precision on use case, avoid scientific notation) (see base.util!)
- Re-organize and consolidate styles.lua, redo style choices for subfactory_bar from the ground up
- Ingredient limit for machines is optional, but still possible; this is not respected (needs machines data rework)


TODO Bug Fixes:


TODO Post-Launch:
! Import/Export of one/all subfactories (and parts of them?)
! Module+Beacon-support
- Better multiplayer support (ex. shared subfactories)
? Ability to calculate based on number of machines instead of amount
? Localisations (DE, FR, others)
? FNEI-links (alt-click?) (needs API from FNEI-author, might already exist)
? Support fluid mining/steam generation recipes
? Add more and/or custom timescales
