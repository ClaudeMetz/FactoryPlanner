[F1] Import/Export
- To export, select all the subfactories that you want to export from a list
- To import, select all the subfactories you want to import from the available ones
- Show validity on import

[F2] Module+Beacon
- UI and UX will be challenging
- Ability to set all modules that a machine supports right on it
- Ability to add which beacons affect each machine
- Have ability for predefined module and beacon configurations (?)

[F3] Multiplayer Cooperation
- Share subfactories between all players on a map
- Distinct visuals for them in the interface, but custom order for everyone
- Read/write-access regulation probably needed?
- Simultaneous change of subfactories might need to be handled?

[F4] Calculation Overhaul
- Handle all complicated scenarios (cycles, multiple recipes for the same product simultaneously
  input based calculations, etc)
- Probably needs a linear algebra approach, which will be hard (see [N2] for hints)
- First step should be to create a clean interface for both a cleaner implementation of
  the calculations and as a way for others to try their luck [N3]

[F5] Machine Fuel [N1]
- Have burners show their fuel consumtion
- Fuel used will be a preference, but adjustable on each recipe by hand

[F6] Belt Hints
- Have a toggleable alternative view that shows belt numbers insead of item numbers on item buttons
- Will be changeable by button and keyboard shortcut
- Item buttons will display the number as well as the belt that is used for the calculation
- Belt used will be a preference that applies globally

[F7] Inserter Hints
- Show an approximation for how many inserters are needed for every item (probably on tooltip)
- Might show a different metric, like item/s, as inserter throughput is hard to approximate

[F8] Dealing with Byproducts
- Have ability to add recipes that use byproducts as inputs and get incorporated in the calculations
- First step should be solvable without a new calculation model

[F9] Bring Subfactories Together
- New view that presents an idealized view of your factory (maybe multiple of those views)
- Let's the user set production goals, and raw resources or planned subfactories as inputs
- Useful as a high-level overview to see what you currently got

[F10] Net Energy Calculation
- Gives you the net energy output of a specified subfactory
- Set up a normal production line, with the addition of an energy producer consuming your product
- Might consider inserter energy usage as well
