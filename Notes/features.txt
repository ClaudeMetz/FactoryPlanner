[F1] Import/Export
- To export, select all the subfactories that you want to export from a list
- To import, select all the subfactories you want to import from the available ones
- Show validity on import

[F2] Module+Beacon
- UI and UX will be challenging
- Ability to set all modules that a machine supports right on it
- Ability to add which beacons affect each machine
- Have ability for predefined module and beacon configurations

[F3] Dealing with Byproducts
- Have ability to add recipes that use byproducts as inputs and get incorporated in the calculations
- First step should be solvable without a new calculation model

[F4] Calculate based on #machines
- Use a number of machines per item as basis for calculation
- Making it a setting only on top level products should make it easier
- Should probably be implemented as a mode switch that automatically converts the values overview
- Switching should preserve the most accurate value used in case you switch back
- Have it switch all of them or only select ones, creating a mix of both? Might be too complicated

[F5] Multiplayer Cooperation
- Share subfactories between all players on a map
- Distinct visuals for them in the interface, but custom order for everyone
- Read/write-access regulation probably needed?
- Simultaneous change of subfactories might need to be handled?

[F6] Item/Recipe data structure Overhaul
- Redo item and recipe data structure to be similar to machines/belts/etc
- Items get assigned a force too so they can exclude items with no recipes correctly
- Should allow for more info on picker tooltips: product already exists, (not researched, hidden,) etc

[F7] Calculation-Interface [N3]
- Clean, independent interface to read subfactory data and write it back
- Should handle all the nitty gritty data structure stuff and be as simple to use as possible
- Useful for implementing an calculation model independent of the data structures that are in place
- This allows for a cleaner internal implementation and for other people to try their luck

[F8] Calculation Overhaul
- Handle all complicated scenarios (cycles, multiple recipes for the same product simultaneously
  input based calculations, etc)
- Probably needs a linear algebra approach, which will be hard (see [N2] for hints)

[F9] Net Energy Calculation
- Gives you the net energy output of a specified subfactory
- Set up a normal production line, with the addition of an energy producer consuming your product
- Might consider inserter energy usage as well

[F10] Bring Subfactories Together
- New view that presents an idealized view of your factory (maybe multiple of those views)
- Let's the user set production goals, and raw resources or planned subfactories as inputs
- Useful as a high-level overview to see what you currently got

[F11] Inserter Hints [N4]
- Show an approximation for how many inserters are needed for every item
- Shown on tooltip for all the desired inserters
- For products/byproducts, show Machine->Belt and Machine->Chest
- For Ingredients, show Belt->Machine and Chest->Machine
- Might be hard to calculate, an approximation should be fine though

[F12] Floor library
- Have a library that the user can fill with floors to be re-used in subfactories
- Create them there (?) or include existing ones, then plop them into place
- Might be linked with canonical version, so changes carry over (probably needs to be case-by-case)
