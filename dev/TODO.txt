TODO Features:
! Info-panel with shortcuts and tutorial + ability to add example subfactory + hint that stays until infos are viewed once(?)


TODO Improvements:
! Convert to 0.17
- Use ESC as a toggle for the main dialog or cancel on a modal dialog (not sure how, may ask FNEI-author _npo6ka_)


TODO Code Improvements:
- Figure out how to do data migrations on new mod versions -> also needs to destroy and re-create GUI's
- Remove/update associated recipes when deleting products + update products/byproducts split each time


TODO Bugs:


TODO 0.17:
- Scaling -> All kinds of sizes seem to be wrong until 0.17, waiting for that to do scaling properly
- *.style.visible -> *.visible, style.align -> style.horizontal-align
- Fancy recipe tooltips using the new text formating
- Replace dump with table_to_json() (+api feature request for log to do it automatically)
- Adjust space science enabling detection listener


TODO Post-Launch:
! DE, FR localisations
! Module+Beacon-support
! Create a custom product selection dialog akin to the recipe dialog [A1]
! Import/Export of one/all subfactories (and parts of them?)
- Better multiplayer support (ex. shared subfactories)
- Un/Re-Do functionality for every user action (with history?)
- Support fluid mining recipes
? FNEI-links (alt-click?)(needs API from FNEI-author, might already exist)
? Add more and/or custom timescales


API Changes:
- (probable) let enter work as a way to submit forms, even when a textfield is in focus
- (posted) have style.padding still available at the control stage for easier changes
- (posted) ability to disable sound on GUI-buttons
- (posted) ability for code to select text in a textfield
