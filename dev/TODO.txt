TODO Features:
! Info-panel with shortcuts and tutorial


TODO Improvements:
! Multiplayer compatability
- Use ESC as a toggle for the main dialog or cancel on a modal dialog (not sure how, may ask FNEI-author _npo6ka_)


TODO Code Improvements:
- Figure out how to do data migrations on new mod versions


TODO Bugs:


TODO 0.17:
- Scaling -> All kinds of sizes seem to be wrong until 0.17, waiting for that to do scaling properly
- *.style.visible -> *.visible
- Fancy recipe tooltips using the new text formating


TODO Post-Launch:
! Module-support
! Export/Import of whole subfactories and parts of them
! DE, FR localisations
! Create a custom product selection dialog akin to the recipe dialog [A1]
- Better multiplayer support (ex. shared subfactories)
? FNEI-links (alt-click?)(needs API from FNEI-author, might already exist)
? Add more and/or custom timescales


API Changes:
- (probable) let enter work as a way to submit forms, even when a textfield is in focus
- (posted) have style.padding still available at the control stage for easier changes
