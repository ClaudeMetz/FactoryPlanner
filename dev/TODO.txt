TODO Features:
! Info-panel with shortcuts and tutorial


TODO Improvements:
! Multiplayer compatability
- Use ESC as a toggle for the main dialog or cancel on a modal dialog (not sure how, may ask FNEI-author _npo6ka_)
- Add miner-recipes (ore, oil) (not sure how, may ask FNEI-contributor mentlerd)


TODO Code Improvements:
- Generalize process of shifting GUI elements to the left/right
? Overhaul /data into class-like system


TODO Bugs:


TODO 0.17:
- Scaling -> All kinds of sizes seem to be wrong until 0.17, waiting for that to do scaling properly
- *.style.visible -> *.visible
- Fancy recipe tooltips using the new fancy text formating


TODO Post-Launch:
! Module-support
! Export/Import of whole subfactories and parts of them
! DE, FR localisations
? Creating a custom product selection dialog akin to the recipe dialog [A1]
? FNEI-links (alt-click?)
? Add more and/or custom timescales
? Better multiplayer support (access rights, etc)


API wishes:
- (probable) let enter work as a way to submit forms, even when a textfield is in focus
- (posted) have style.padding still available at the control stage for easier changes
