# TODO

- Add floating text for all actions that are taken that are not possible
  - Ideally the tooltips and context menu wouldn't show them, but that is tricky
  - It's actually kinda confusing that it shows impossible actions now, should really fix that
- Could now store blueprints from the library I think
