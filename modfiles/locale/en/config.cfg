interactive_tutorial_title=Interactive Tutorial
interactive_tutorial_text=The best way to familiarize yourself with Factory Planner is by just jumping right in and exploring it yourself. To that end, I have included an example subfactory that will show off some of this mod’s most important features. You can add it by clicking the button below. You can also activate ’Tutorial Mode’, which shows all the keyboard combinations that are possible on important buttons all over the interface.

# Usage
tutorial_usage_text=First, you will need to create a subfactory. This is the basic structure that contains some (mostly independent) part of your factory. Give it a name and/or an icon, and off you go. It will have some inputs (ingredients), some outputs (products and byproducts) and consume a certain amount of energy. You can also set the timescale you want to work with, or scribble down some notes.\n\nWhat you are interested in are the products, so you will need to add the ones you want to produce. To do that, simply click the ’+’-button, select the product you want and specify the amount that should be produced. It will have a red background, and, when hovering over it, you will see that there is currently 0 of it being produced.\n\nTo change that, you left-click on it. If there is only one recipe to produce this product, it will be added right away. Otherwise, you will have the choice of which recipe to use. Either way, a new recipe will show up on the top floor of your subfactory. You can change the machine being used or add some modules and beacons.\n\nNow to further break down the product you want to produce, you can left-click on the ingredients of an existing recipe. This will once again add a recipe, changing the ingredients needed for the whole subfactory. You can continue breaking down your product in this way until you arrive at only plates as ingredients for example, or drill even deeper and add your mining and smelting recipes too. Whatever is most convenient for you and your existing factory.\n\nFor items with a large amount of intermediate products, your collection of recipes can get quite messy quite quickly. To deal with this, you can have multiple floors with different recipes on each of them. To create a so-called subfloor, left-click on the recipe icon of the recipe you want to work out further. This gets you a subfloor (notice the level will be displayed as ’2’) in which you can add recipes just like before. The big difference being that you only need to worry about the ingredients of the recipe you left-clicked on.\n\nAnd those are the basics! There are some more advanced features that come in handy (check out the ’Pro Tips’), but this should get you started. Create the example subfactory (button at the top of this window) if you want to play around with a basic production line.

# Pro Tips
pro_hovering=Hovering over many buttons and labels will reveal some additional information, like the recipe or item’s full name, or a higher precision number, should you need it.
pro_list_ordering=Pretty much every list you see can be re-ordered by you. Just hold the shift- or control-key while left-clicking on an element. The order only really matters for the recipes on a production floor.
pro_up_down_grading=Try shift- or control-clicking on a machine, beacon or module. It will up- or downgrade them, if possible.
pro_preferences=In preferences, you can set the default machine to be used for each type of recipe. This allows you adjust them to your current tech level, allowing for quicker factory planning. The same goes for belts, fuels and beacons.
pro_interface_size=If the main window takes up too much or too little space on your screen, try changing the interface width- and height-settings. (Menu→Settings→Mod Settings→Factory Planner)
pro_recursive_subfloors=You can create a subfloor for a recipe that is already on a subfloor. This can be done as many times as you like, creating a deeply nested structure of subfloors.
pro_archive=The archive is a good way to store subfactories that aren’t in active use anymore, but you might want to refer back to at some point.
pro_settings=Some advanced features aren’t active by default. Instead, they hide in mod settings (Menu→Settings→Mod Settings→Factory Planner). Take a look, you’ll find things like interface size adjustment and some defaults to be set.
pro_shortcuts=You can configure several keyboard shortcuts to get around the interface faster. They can be found in ’Controls’ (Menu→Settings→Controls→Factory Planner).
pro_views=There are several different views that you can cycle through with __CONTROL__fp_cycle_production_views__. They allow for different perspectives on your factory, which makes building it easier, as they give you information on how many belts and inserters you will need.
pro_line_fuel=The kind of fuel that a recipe uses can be changed by left-clicking its button (blue background). By default, it will use the choice you make in preferences.
pro_machine_limits=You can set a limit on the amount of machines a recipe uses. Either set a ’soft’ limit that prevents it from going over the configured amount, or set a ’hard’ limit, which will force the recipe to use the configured amount of machines.
pro_priority_product=Every recipe with more than one relevant products can have a priority product. You set it by right-clicking on the product you want to be prioritized. This has the effect that the demands on that item are met exactly, irrespective of any other demand.
