interface_controls_recipebook=\n• __CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__Alt + Right-click__CONTROL_STYLE_END__: Open in Recipe Book

# Usage
tutorial_usage_text=First, you will need to create a subfactory. This is the basic structure that contains some (mostly independent) part of your factory. Give it a name and off you go. It will have some inputs (ingredients), some outputs (products and byproducts), and consume a certain amount of energy. You can also set the timescale you want to work with, or scribble down some notes.\n\nWhat you are interested in are the products, so you will need to add the ones you want to produce. To do that, simply __CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__left-click__CONTROL_STYLE_END__ the [font=default-semibold]+[/font]-button, select the product you want and specify the amount that should be produced. It will have a red background, and, when hovering over it, you will see that there is currently [font=default-semibold]0[/font] of it being produced.\n\nTo change that, you __CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__left-click__CONTROL_STYLE_END__ on it. If there is only one recipe to produce this product, it will be added right away. Otherwise, you will have the choice of which recipe to use. Either way, a new recipe will show up on the top floor of your subfactory. You can change the machine being used or add some modules and beacons.\n\nNow to further break down the product you want to produce, you can __CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__left-click__CONTROL_STYLE_END__ on the ingredients of an existing recipe. This will once again add a recipe, changing the ingredients needed for the whole subfactory. You can continue breaking down your product in this way until you arrive at only plates as ingredients for example, or drill even deeper and add your mining and smelting recipes too. Whatever is most convenient for you and your existing factory.\n\nFor items with a large amount of intermediate products, your collection of recipes can get quite messy quite quickly. To deal with this, you can have multiple floors with different recipes on each of them. To create a so-called subfloor, __CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__left-click__CONTROL_STYLE_END__ on the recipe icon of the recipe you want to work out further. This gets you a subfloor (notice the level will be displayed as [font=default-semibold]2[/font]) in which you can add recipes just like before. The big difference being that you only need to worry about the ingredients of the recipe you clicked on.\n\nAnd those are the basics! There are some more advanced features that come in handy, but this should get you started. Create the example subfactory (in the [font=default-semibold]Interface[/font] tab) if you want to play around with a basic production line.

# Matrix Solver
tutorial_matrix_solver_text=The matrix solver is an alternative method for updating the production table. By default Factory Planner solves the table from top to bottom, while the matrix solver solves every line simultaneously with a system of equations. The matrix solver can be tricky to use, but is also very powerful. For example, it handles recycling, voiding, and loops. \n\nEach subfactory is set to one of two solvers, the sequential solver (default) or the matrix solver. To switch to the matrix solver, toggle the solver switch in the bottom left to "matrix". The matrix solver will stay active until the switch is toggled again, and will automatically re-run when recipes are changed. \n\nEnabling the matrix solver also enables byproduct selection. To remove a byproduct, click either a recipe byproduct within a line or a subfactory byproduct at the top. This will show recipes where byproduct is an ingredient, including voids. \n\nSometimes the matrix solver requires certain items be set to "unrestricted." Normally items are balanced out, meaning they are consumed as fast as they are produced. However, "unrestricted items" do not balance out, and will appear as final ingredients or byproducts. If unrestricted items are required, a dialog will open to select unrestricted items. Unrestricted items are often needed when a subfactory contains a loop. To open this dialog, press the gear icon to the right of the solver toggle. \n\nOne last requirement is the recipes must be linearly independent. This means there can only be one unique solution for the current subfactory. In other words, the matrix solver will not work if there are multiple ways to create the given products. If the subfactory has linearly dependent recipes, try removing redundant recipes until the error goes away. This requirement holds across all subfloors.
