fp_display_gui_button=Shows the button on the top left of the screen. It opens and closes the main interface.
fp_pause_on_interface=Makes it so the game gets paused every time you open the interface of the mod (Singleplayer only).
fp_performance_mode=Disables certain performance-intensive features, including:\n- Ingredient satisfaction calculations\n- Item search without confirmation
fp_subfactory_items_per_row=Set the main interface width by choosing how many top-level items (ingredients / products / byproducts) are shown per row.
fp_floor_recipes_at_once=Set the main interface height by choosing how many recipe lines you want to see without scrolling.
fp_default_timescale=Choose the timescale that any new subfactory should be created with.
fp_view_belts_or_lanes=Indicate whether you think of item throughput as lanes or as full belts.
fp_line_comments=Attaches a comment textfield to every recipe line.
fp_ingredient_satisfaction=Shows whether the ingredient-demands of a recipe are satisfied by the recipes below them.
fp_round_button_numbers=Rounds the numbers on machine- and belts/lanes-buttons. This setting is ignored for machine-buttons if the 'Machine rounding precision'-setting is active.
fp_indicate_rounding=Sets the precision with which machine numbers are rounded. For example, setting this to 0.05 means a machine number of 1.96 will show as a perfect 2 machines, while 1.94 will show as being rounded up. This also works in the opposite direction, meaning 2.04 shows as a perfect 2 machines. Setting this to 0 disables the feature.

preferences_ignore_barreling_recipes=Ignore barreling and stacking recipes
preferences_ignore_recycling_recipes=Ignore recycling recipes
interface_text=The interface is implemented in a way where similar functionality shares the same way of using it. This prevents you from having to remember which action will result in which change for all of them. You just have to learn these few interactions and apply them everywhere:\n\n- Left-click: Select/Use\n- Right-click: Edit/Delete\n- Shift-left-click: Move up list item/upgrade\n- Control-left-click: Move down list item/downgrade
usage_text=First, you will need to create a subfactory. This is the basic structure that contains some (mostly independent) part of your factory. Give it a name and/or an icon, and off you go. It will have some inputs (ingredients), some outputs (products and byproducts) and consume a certain amount of energy. You can also set the timescale you want to work with, or scribble down some notes.\n\nWhat you are interested in are the products, so you will need to add the ones you want to produce. To do that, simply click the '+'-button, select the product you want and specify the amount that should be produced. It will have a red background, and, when hovering over it, you will see that there is currently 0 of it being produced.\n\nTo change that, you left-click on it. If there is only one recipe to produce this product, it will get added right away. Otherwise, you will have the choice of which recipe to use. Either way, a new recipe will show up on the top floor of your subfactory. You can change the machine being used, or move it up and down in the list.\n\nNow to further break down the product you want to produce, you can left-click on the ingredients of an existing recipe. This will once again add a recipe, changing the ingredients shown for the whole subfactory. You can continue breaking down your product in this way until you arrive at only plates as ingredients for example, or drill even deeper and add your mining and smelting recipes too. Whatever is most convenient for you and your existing factory.\n\nFor items with a large amount of intermediate products, your collection of recipes can get quite messy quite quickly. To deal with this, you can have multiple floors with different recipes on each of them. To create a so-called subfloor, left-click on the recipe icon of the recipe you want to work out further. This gets you a subfloor (notice the level will be displayed as '2') in which you can add recipes just like before. The big difference being that you only need to worry about the ingredients of the recipe you left-clicked on.\n\nAnd those are the basics! There are some more advanced features that you might like (check out the Pro Tips below), but this should get you started. Create the example subfactory (button at the top of this window) if you want to play around with a basic production line.
pro_hovering=Hovering over many buttons or text-labels will reveal more detailed information, like the full name of whatever you hover over, or a higher precision number, should you need it.
pro_list_ordering=Pretty much every list you see can be reordered by you. Just hold the shift- or control-key while left-clicking on an element. The order only really matters for the recipes on a production floor.
pro_machine_changing=Try shift- or control-clicking on the machine button of a recipe. It will up- or downgrade the machine that is used, if possible.
pro_machine_preferences=In preferences, you can set the default machine to be used for each type of recipe. This allows you to set them to the tech level you are currently at, allowing for more seamless subfactory planning.
pro_interface_width=If the main window takes up too much/too little horizontal space on your screen, try changing the 'Interface-width'-setting in the mod settings. (Menu→Options→Mod Settings→Factory Planner)
pro_fnei=Factory Planner works with FNEI! Just alt-click on any item or recipe, and it shall be shown to you inside FNEI (if it's installed, of course). Left- or right-clicks work in the same way, where right-clicks show you recipes to produce the selected item, and left-clicks show you all the ways to use it.
pro_recipe_consolidation=Having subfloors allows you to easily consolidate the production of an ingredient needed in multiple recipes. For example, don't add the recipe for iron gears to every single subfloor. Instead, add it at the end of your main floor, which will make it produce enough gears for all the recipes that need them.
pro_recursive_subfloors=You can create a subfloor for a recipe that already is on a subfloor. This can be done as many times as you like, creating a deeply nested structure of subfloors.
