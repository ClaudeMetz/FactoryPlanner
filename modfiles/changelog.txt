---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.34
Date: 18. 06. 2020
  Changes:
    - Made the item-percentage-utility textfield wider

    - Added a missing locale key for the new pause-on-interface keyboard shortcut

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.33
Date: 16. 06. 2020
  Features:
    - Added the ability to set recipe product/byproduct/ingredient-amounts to specific values. You can do this by right-clicking any of them on a specific recipe line and entering an amount. The percentage of that line will then automatically be adjusted to produce that amount exactly.
  Changes:
    - The mod-setting for pausing the game when the main interface is open is now a button in the top right of it
    - The numbers shown on item/machine/etc-buttons are now rounded somewhat correctly, instead of being truncated
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that beacon selection would not work then the game was being paused on open FP-interface

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.32
Date: 15. 06. 2020
  Changes:
    - Improved some things about how product definitions by belt/lane are handled. Changing timescales now also better preserves the precision of the numbers you enter.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed several problems leading to incorrect results when using productivity modules
    - Fixed that the top level products wouldn't update their numbers when in belts/lanes-view and changing the preferred belt

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.18.30
Date: 12. 06. 2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that crafting machines producing more than 1 item/tick would show incorrect results, especially when productivity was involved. Thanks a lot to curiosity for helping me figure this one out.
    - Fixed a bug where using productivity on certain recipes (like koravex enrichment) would not produce correct results
    - Fixed a bug where byproducts produced on a subfloor were not incorporated correctly on their parent floor
    - Fixed a bug where a recipe line's byproducts were not consumed by the fuel that that line needed

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.29
Date: 09. 06. 2020
  Features:
    - Added an indication to the machines/modules in the utility dialog that shows whether you have the needed machines/modules in your inventory

Date: 07. 06. 2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a bad mistake on my part that screwed up all the things
    - Added a migration so your preferred belts, beacons and machines are not lost. Fuels will still be reset though.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.27
Date: 07. 06. 2020
  Features:
    - Now supports any kind of item-fuel, which includes things like mining drills from Pyanodon's and others. Might reset some of the fuels you selected to their default. I'm sorry about this, I tried to migrate it where I could, but there were large background changes that made it so it doesn't work in every case.
    - Also added support for some fluid-fuels. Machines like Bob's steam assembler are still not supported, as the way they work is complicated and requires more background work on my part.
  Changes:
    - The belt/fuel/beacon/machine-choices in preferences are now sorted by their most important attributes. Also added some new attributes to the tooltips.
    - Changed the alt-action preference to be a mod setting instead
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash when attempting to repair certain subfactories
    - Fixed that once set, module-preferences could not be unset anymore

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.24
Date: 01. 06. 2020
  Changes:
    - This update contains an unusually large amount of background changes, so there might be some instability (ie. crashes) for a day or two, until I can sort them all out
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash on load in certain modded situations

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.23
Date: 30. 05. 2020
  Changes:
    - Added support for any modded rocket silo recipes, instead of only vanilla space science
    - Combined the two rocket building recipes into one, making it so you don't have to produce rocket parts anymore, you just select the end product (most of the time, this will be space science), and it'll show the ingredients directly, removing an unnecessary step

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.22
Date: 30. 05. 2020
  Changes:
    - Allowed products to have an amount of 0 again
  Bugfixes:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.19
Date: 27. 05. 2020
  Changes:
    - Adjusted some interface styles due to changes that came with Factorio 0.18.27

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.18
Date: 25. 05. 2020
  Features:
    - Added a preference where you can specify a default module for both machines and beacons, as well as a default beacon count. These preferences cause newly created recipe lines to automatically be maxed out with the specified modules and beacons. This makes it less work to create a fully beacon-ed setup. This functionality is pretty bare-bones and not very smart, but it's a good start.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash when loading a map that used certain kinds of recipes
    - Fixed the rocket-part item not being visible anymore in the product picker

    - Fixed that fuel would sometimes show up on the top floor as an ingredient when it's already being produced on a subfloor
    - Fixed that recipes with certain complicated product definitions would not be useable

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.15
Date: 20. 05. 2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a bug where the recipe picker didn't show the appropriate recipes in some cases
    - Fixed that adding recipes which used hidden items would crash
    - Fixed that a recipe would sometimes show as being able to use fluids as ingredients/products, while actually not being able to do so
    - Fixed a crash when alt-tabbing or changing resolution while a popup dialog was open
    - (Probably) fixed a crash when the space science-item is being removed by another mod

  Bugfixes:
    - Added a temporary fix for some dialogs showing up behind the main interface. I'll have to wait on the reaction of the devs for a proper fix. For now, opening the product picker dialog will be slower. Sorry about that.
    - Fixed that rocket silo recipes would be calculated incorrectly, which had lead to inaccurate machine counts and wacky numbers when using the items/s/machine view
    - Fixed that machines with negative pollution values would display as having 0 pollution
    - Fixed that you could be stranded on a non-existant subfloor after deleting its main recipe
    - Fixed that alt-tabbing or changing resolution while FP is pausing the game could cause it to be stuck in the paused state
    - Fixed that deleting subfloors could sometimes leave behind remnants that lead to a crash when clicked on
    - Fixed that energy consumption for machines in tooltips was off by a factor of 60; The calculations were still correct

  Features:
    - Update for 0.18. It also contains some smaller features and a lot of background optimizations. There are still quite a few bugs that have been reported and not fixed, I wanted to get the 0.18 patch out quickly. Thanks to everyone that reported things, it's very much appreciated. I kind of fell off the development-train in December because of exams and the festivities, and haven't gotten back on the horse really. I'll try to address the outstanding bugs soon, and hopefully get back to feature development at some point.
  Changes:
    - Reworked the recipe picker to be easier to use. Most recipes now use the fancy new tooltips.
    - Various graphical and performance improvements

Version: 0.17.55
Date: 18. 10. 2019
  Features:
    - [Warning: Experimental!] This version is a complete rewrite of the calculation backbone of the mod, so it's likely to contain some crashes and bugs. I'd love it if you reported them to me on the mod portal.
    - This rewrite was done to allow me to implement some much requested features and to fix some bugs that wouldn't be fixable otherwise. The ability to add recipes that consume byproducts didn't make it for this version, but will get done at some point, hopefully soon-ish!
    - Added the ability to select which product is the main product of a recipe, which allows you to have more control over how many times this recipe is run. Left-click any product of a recipe line with multiple products to activate this feature.
    - Added the ability to set a cap/limit to how many machines a recipe line uses. Right-click the machine button to set it.
    - Added a mod setting ('Line satisfaction') that, when enabled, shows whether the ingredients of a recipe line are produced by the recipes below them or not. This allows you to more easily discern which recipes you might still need to add.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that fuels that originate on subfloors weren't always shown correctly on their parent floors
    - Fixed that fuels didn't always show up as the last ingredients in a recipe line, and that changing them in bulk didn't behave correctly
