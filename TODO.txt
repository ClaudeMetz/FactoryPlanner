TODO Features:
- Timescale setting
- Scaling
- Multiplayer compatability
- Info pane with shortcuts / small Tutorial
- Make the Subfactory bar scalable (row-breakoff, multiple rows)
? Custom notes for subfactories


TODO Improvements:
- Think of a reasonable order for functions in each file
- error handling to prevent crashing the whole save (not sure how)
? Make the GUI close itself when loading the save
? create testsuite for sprite+label-buttons to test their jank size determination
? add some special characters for subfactory names
? reconsider recipe- and production-pane naming, seems kind of unfitting


BUGS:
- actual Sprite size doesn't adjust to height and width, only it's 'box' does
    fix might be coming in 0.17
? not whole frame considered part of GuiElement, fires no on_gui_click event (see subfactory_dialog)
    not too bad, might take this listener out anyway, might not be worth it
? subfactory_bar spacing is a super-mess on different resoultions and scaling modes,
    sprite resizing is also still not fixable, might need to reconsider

TODO 0.17:
- *.style.visible -> *.visible

TODO Post-Launch:
! Modules
! Export/Import
- Better multiplayer support (access rights, etc)
? FNEI Linking
? Power Planning


API wishes for change:
- (A) let enter work as a way to submit forms, even when a textfield is in focus-
- 


MISC:
- Count LOC: ( find ./ -name '*.lua' -print0 | xargs -0 cat ) | wc -l
