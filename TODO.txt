TODO Features:
- Info pane with shortcuts and tutorial
? Custom notes for subfactories
? Add some special characters for subfactory names
? Add more and/or custom timescales


TODO Improvements:
- Scaling
- Multiplayer compatability
- Make the Subfactory bar scalable (row-breakoff, multiple rows)
- Make sure saved subfactories stay consistent when mods are added/removed/updated
- Make the GUI close itself when loading the save
- Add error handling to prevent crashing the whole save (not sure how)
- Find a better spot for the product-delete-button, looks very awkward currently
    -> Integrate option for deletion into modal dialog, new arguemnt for enter_* functions that
       separates modal dialog args from regular ones
- Add changelog.txt (see LoadersRedux)
- Care about uncategorized recipes? Pretty much miner recipes only, kind of sketchy
? Remove some of the button click sounds like the game does


TODO Code Improvements:
- Think of sensible refresh strategy for GUI's -> level approach, top GUI's always refresh those under them,
    but not the reverse; each level is individually callable
- Verify that subfactories are actually only changed in /data
- Think of a reasonable order for functions in each file + general refactoring ->
    modal_dialog file, split up recipe_pane, rename util functions with preceding 'util.', ...)
- Generalize and merge process of shifting of GUI elements to the left/right
- Create a system test writeup to maintain functionality after changes are implemented
- Performance: Make recipe table only reload itself after new technology has been researched (also already create GUI already?)
- Performance: render recipe selector subgroups only when they are to be displayed, then cache them
- Think about putting more style options into proper styles
? Create testsuite for sprite+label-buttons to test their jank size determination
? Reconsider recipe- and production-pane naming, seems kind of unfitting


BUGS:
- Subfactory switching errors out sometimes after deleting a subfactory (selected_subfactory_id overhaul might be needed)
- actual Sprite size doesn't adjust to height and width, only it's 'box' does
    fix might be coming in 0.17
? not whole frame considered part of GuiElement, fires no on_gui_click event (see subfactory_dialog)
    not too bad, might take this listener out anyway, might not be worth it
? subfactory_bar spacing is a super-mess on different resoultions and scaling modes,
    sprite resizing is also still not fixable, might need to reconsider


TODO 0.17:
- *.style.visible -> *.visible
- Fancy recipe tooltips using the new fancy text formating


TODO Post-Launch:
! Modules
! Export/Import
! Improved recipe search
- DE, FR Localisations
? Better multiplayer support (access rights, etc)
? FNEI Linking
? Power Planning (separate mod?)


API wishes for change:
- (A) let enter work as a way to submit forms, even when a textfield is in focus


MISC:
- Count LOC: ( find ./ -name '*.lua' -print0 | xargs -0 cat ) | wc -l
- Replace commit on origin/: git push --force origin
