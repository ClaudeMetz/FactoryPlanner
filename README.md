# Factory Planner

Factory Planner is a mod for the game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com). It is published in zip-format on the Factorio [mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/factoryplanner), which allows it to be downloaded and updated by players in-game.

It enables players to plan out their production in detail, specifying the recipes, machines and modules to use. It allows for conceptual separation of assembly lines through the use of separate floors that can be nested infinitely. There exist calculators on the web that can do this already, but a big advantage a mod has is that it can incorporate the exact combination of mods the user has installed, with up-to-date information, which is something that external solutions struggle to provide.

My focus when creating the interface for this mod was on making it as clear and intuitive as possible while offering all the features that power users need. To that end, users should be able to get started on their first plans relatively easily, after which they can gradually explore all the functionality that is offered. The interface was created with all the modern design standards and interaction paradigms in mind, making it conform well to both user's expectations and the rest of the game.

There is a public [project board](https://github.com/users/ClaudeMetz/projects/1) organizing what's on my radar. Suggestions and bug reports are centralized here on Github. Feel free to join the Factory Planner [Discord](https://discord.gg/ABqNEQc) to talk to me and others in a more casual way.

I'm happy to hear about any ideas you have, but this mod is still in active development and I might already have a plan for what you're thinking about. You can of course also open an issue to talk about your ideas.
