# Factory Planner

This is a mod for the game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com). It is published in zip-format on the Factorio [mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/), which allows it to be downloaded and updated in-game by the users/players.

It enables players to plan out their production in detail, specifying the recipes, machines and modules to use. It allows for conceptual separation of assembly lines through the use of separate floors that can be nested infinitely. There exist calculators on the web that can do this already. The advantage an in-game solution has is that the plans remain attached to a savegame and are always right where you need them, updated to the latest version. Additionally, it can incorporate every combination of mods the user has installed, with up-to-date information, which is something that external solutions can never provide.

Something similar has already been done by [Helmod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/helmod). One major goal of this was to provide a more intuitive and convenient experience than that Helmod, all while providing features that are equally as powerful. It should have better performance and allow for complex recipes to be handled appropriately. Not all of these goals have been reached, and some features are still missing, but in due time, the mod will improve to meet it's goals.

There is a public [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/0FP7eMlu/factory-planner) organizing what's on my radar. Suggestions and bug reports go to the [mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/factoryplanner/discussion) for now. You might also join the Factory Planner [Discord](https://discord.gg/ABqNEQc) to talk to me more directly/casually.

## Contribute

If you want to contribute to Factory Planner in any form, please join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/ABqNEQc) and talk to me about what you have in mind first. This mod is still in active development, and I might already have a plan for what you're thinking about. But I'm happy to hear about any ideas you have. Issues are disabled for this repo because I'd like to centralize them on the [mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/factoryplanner/discussion) so non-technical users can participate more easily.
